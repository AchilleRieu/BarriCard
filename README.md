Our First Play-to-Earn Game

Made By Achille RIEU & Arthur THEILLIER


Game progress :

1) Player 1 & 2 choose 10 cards in their deck
2) Card shuffle
3) Card battle
  a) Each card of each player is turned over one after the other
      Each time cards are turned over, the best card wins and the winner gets one point. If it is the same card, each player wins 1 point.
4)The player with the most points wins the game.
5) The winner can choose a card from the opponent and take it.
6) If there is a tie, no one wins. The game is over.


Matchmaking : Each card has a value defined by its numerical value. The value of a player's chosen deck is calculated by adding up the values of his 10 cards. The player only plays against players whose deck has a similar value.
